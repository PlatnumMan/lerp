# Neural Network Visualization with p5.js ðŸŽ¨

This project provides an interactive neural network visualization using the p5.js library. Users can see the structure of the neural network, witness animated gradient lines that give the illusion of data flow, and observe data as it moves between layers with a simple mouse click.


## Features:

- Interactive nodes: Hover to see an enlarged node.
- Animated gradient lines: Lines between nodes show the flow of data with animated gradients.
- Data flow visualization: Click anywhere on the canvas to generate data points that flow between the layers.

## How to Use:

1. Clone this repository.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PlatnumMan/lerp.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the directory.
    ```bash
    cd lerp
    ```

3. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

4. Click anywhere on the canvas to visualize the flow of data between layers.

## Dependencies:

- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) - JavaScript library for creative coding.
